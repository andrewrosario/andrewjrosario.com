			<p>A long, long time ago (in the '90s) before online games were much of a think. All we had were console platformers and side-scrollers. With my relatively poor hand-eye corrdination and reaction speed, this was not a good time in gaming for me. That was until my friends and I discovered MUDs. Mult-user dungeons, were an extension of the Dungeons and Dragons we were already playing and a pre-cursor of todays MMORPGs. I fell in love and my first experiences with coding were tinkering with open source MUD code and trying to build my own. <br><br> Press continue to get a (very simplified) taste of a MUD.</p>

				<p id="roomDescription">Entrance to the Enterprise<br><br>As you slowly open your eyes, you find yourself in a large, poorly-lit room on the starship Enterprise. Overhead, a harsh strobe light flashes on and off, revealing your surroundings one second at a time. Grimy metal walls with exposed electrical pipes, strange slimy mold puddles on the floor, and an acrid smell permeates the air. Dazed, you shake off your stupor, and attempt to figure out whatâ€™s going on. A small corridor opens up in front of you. Looking to the left, you notice another hallway, more brightly lit than the one to your north. Behind you, a large metal door blocks the way. <br><br>You may travel (N)orth or (W)est</p>
